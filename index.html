            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><center>
            My name is Mari치n Gloser, a <span id="birthday"></span> year old from Slovakia and I am a 1st year Masters student at the University
            of Vienna, studying Pure Mathematics. Before doing my masters in Vienna, I did my Bachelor of Science at
            the Bocconi University in Milan. My mathematical interests include
            Analysis, Number Theory, Coding and Computer Science. Other interests include playing
            the piano, drawing, walking, watching movies, reading books and a little bit of magic tricks.

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><center>
                I grew up in Slovakia, studying at the local elementary school and high school in my hometown. I took up
                an interest in Mathematics, Computer science and Physics early on, participating at competitions such as
                the Mathematical Olympiad and Physics Olympiad and also writing some exploratory papers on some
                interesting mathematical topics starting at the end of elementary school, some of which are posted below.
                After high school, I decided to enroll at the University of Bocconi to attend the Mathematics for AI program.
                During my years in Milan I further developed my mathematical skills as well as my coding abilities. After finishing my
                degree there, I decided to enroll at the University of Vienna for the Masters in Mathematics program. Currently,
                I am also working as a student research assistant at the University of Vienna.

            <p><center>
            This was the first paper I have ever written, I was 15 years old at the time. As one can imagine, there is nothing
            groundbreaking about this paper, but it provides a solid foundation in irrational numbers for those interested with some
            prerequisite mathematical background.

            <p><center>
            This is a fun paper I wrote just to collect some neat ideas I had throughout highschool. The theorems are in no way connected
            to one another but rather are supposed to be often overlooked in each respective area, while still being used a lot or having
            great applications.

            <h3 class = "vspace">On the Sums of Powers of Natural Numbers (Unpublished)</h3>
            <p><center>
            This was a huge leap for me in terms of my mathematical achievements. I derived a closed formula (albeit not very useful)
            for a notorious sum which was solved first time by Jacob Bernoulli. I used a very different and new approach to derive the
            formula.
